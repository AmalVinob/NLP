# Topic Modeling of Airbnb Dataset Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

This project applies **topic modeling** on an Airbnb dataset using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**. The objective is to analyze the text data from Airbnb reviews or descriptions, extract themes, and gain insights into guest sentiments, popular amenities, and overall user experience.

## Project Overview
In recent years, Airbnb has become a popular platform for short-term lodging, offering a wide variety of accommodations globally. As part of the sharing economy, Airbnb generates vast amounts of user-generated data, particularly through guest reviews and listing descriptions. This data is valuable for understanding guest experiences, identifying areas for improvement, and informing hosts about key factors that impact guest satisfaction. However, due to the sheer volume of text data, it is challenging to manually analyze and extract meaningful insights from this information.

Topic modeling is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that helps in discovering the underlying themes, or "topics," within a large collection of documents. Topics are typically groups of words that frequently occur together and represent common themes or concepts. This project utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), one of the most widely used algorithms for topic modeling, to uncover hidden topics within the Airbnb dataset. Specifically, we apply LDA to text data from Airbnb reviews or listing descriptions, aiming to capture the main themes and trends that shape the Airbnb user experience.
- Identify popular topics and themes in reviews or listing descriptions.
- Discover patterns in guest preferences or common issues in listings.
- Provide data-driven insights to improve guest experience and inform hosts.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains reviews and listing descriptions from Airbnb. You can download the dataset from Inside Airbnb or another reliable source.
- Data Source: Inside Airbnb
